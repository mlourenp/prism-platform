# Prism Infrastructure Platform

This directory contains the open-source infrastructure foundation that provides infrastructure abstractions, cell definitions, and observability stack for cloud-native applications.

## Structure

- **infrastructure/**: Terraform modules for provisioning cloud infrastructure (EKS, VPC, etc.)
- **definitions/**: 
  - **cells/**: Crossplane compositions defining different cell types (logic, data, security, etc.)
  - **crossplane/**: Core Crossplane configuration and provider definitions
  - **kubernetes/**: Kubernetes manifests for platform infrastructure services
- **observability/**: Complete observability stack configurations
  - **ebpf/**: eBPF-based tooling (Cilium, Falco, Tetragon, etc.)
  - **configs/**: Prometheus, alerting, and monitoring configurations
  - **dashboards/**: Grafana dashboards and visualization configs

## Open Source Strategy

This platform directory provides a complete cloud-native infrastructure platform for multi-cloud resource management and observability.

The platform enables:
- Cell-based architecture for workload isolation and organization
- Multi-cloud infrastructure provisioning via Crossplane
- Comprehensive observability with eBPF integration for high-performance monitoring
- Automated scaling and resource management across cloud providers
- Production-ready security policies and network isolation
- Cost transparency and optimization across infrastructure resources

## Key Components

### Cell-Based Architecture
- **Logic Cells**: Computational and analytical workloads
- **Channel Cells**: API gateways and external communication endpoints  
- **Data Cells**: Storage, databases, and data processing workloads
- **Security Cells**: Authentication, authorization, and compliance services
- **External Cells**: Third-party integrations and external service connections
- **Integration Cells**: Workflow orchestration and service integration
- **Legacy Cells**: Legacy system integration and modernization
- **Observability Cells**: Monitoring, logging, and telemetry infrastructure

### Infrastructure Foundation
- Multi-cloud orchestration via Crossplane
- Kubernetes-native infrastructure management
- eBPF-powered networking and security
- Production-ready observability stack
- Cost optimization and resource right-sizing
